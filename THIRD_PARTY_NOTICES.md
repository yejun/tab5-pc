## Fetched by the tools and built into the firmware

None of this is kept in this repository. `tools/fetch_vendor.sh` fetches it at pinned versions, and the Arduino
toolchain provides the rest. A compiled firmware image contains all of it. The released images come with
`tab5-pc-<version>-NOTICES.txt` (all the notices and license texts) and `tab5-pc-<version>-source.tar.gz` (the
corresponding source, including the LGPL parts); see [`docs/DISTRIBUTION.md`](docs/DISTRIBUTION.md).

**[tiny386](https://github.com/hchunhui/tiny386)** at `vendor/tiny386.commit` (2c1205cf1212), with `vendor/patches`.
Its README states: "The cpu emulator and the project as a whole are both licensed under the BSD-3-Clause license.
Adlib emulation is an optional part of the project, and it requires the library fmopl which is licensed under the
LGPL. [...] SeaBIOS is distributed under the GNU LGPL-3 license. Some parts ported from QEMU/TinyEMU are under the
MIT license." The files the firmware compiles (through `firmware/tab5_386/src/t386_*.c`), by their own headers:

| tiny386 file | License | Copyright |
|---|---|---|
| `i386.c`, `fpu.c`, `pc.c`, `misc.c` and headers without a notice | BSD-3-Clause (tiny386's `LICENSE`) | (c) 2024-2025 Chunhui He |
| `fmopl.c`, `fmopl.h`, and `fmopl.inc` (generated from `fmopl.c`) | **LGPL-2.1-or-later** | (c) 1999, 2000 Tatsuyuki Satoh, MultiArcadeMachineEmurator development |
| `adlib.c`, `sb16.c`, `i8257.c` | MIT | (c) 2004-2005, 2003-2005, 2003-2004 Vassili Karpov (malc) |
| `vga.c`, `ide.c`, `i8042.c`, `i8254.c`, `i8259.c`, `ne2000.c`, `pci.c` | MIT | Fabrice Bellard (years in each file) |
| `pcspk.c` | MIT | (c) 2006 Joachim Henke |
| `ini.c`, `ini.h` (inih) | BSD-3-Clause | (c) 2009-2020 Ben Hoyt |
| `vgafont.c` (the VGA text font) | no notice in the file; provenance not established | |

**SeaBIOS and its VGA BIOS** (LGPL-3.0), built into the firmware as data (`tools/gen_bios.sh`). The images are
pinned in `vendor/bios.lock`: SeaBIOS rel-1.17.0-20-g81ec9ec0 (coreboot/seabios 81ec9ec0bcf4) with tiny386's
`seabios/patch` (as `vendor/patches/0027` changes it) and `seabios/config`. `tools/build_seabios.sh` builds them from
that source (the BIOS is built so by `tools/fetch_vendor.sh`; the VGA BIOS is tiny386's release image).

**[ESP-Hosted](https://github.com/espressif/esp-hosted-mcu)**, the SDIO host driver at `vendor/esp-hosted.commit`
(2.12.8), with `vendor/patches/esp-hosted`. Apache-2.0, (c) Espressif Systems (Shanghai) CO LTD.

**The Arduino toolchain** (the versions this project is built with):

- the M5Stack board package `m5stack:esp32` 3.3.10: the Arduino core for ESP32 (arduino-esp32, LGPL-2.1 as a whole,
  with files under other licenses) and ESP-IDF v5.5.4's precompiled libraries (Apache-2.0, with components under
  their own licenses: FreeRTOS, lwIP, mbedTLS, newlib, TinyUSB, ESP-Hosted, ...);
- [M5Unified](https://github.com/m5stack/M5Unified) 0.2.29 (MIT, (c) 2021 M5Stack);
- [M5GFX](https://github.com/m5stack/M5GFX) 0.3.0 (MIT, (c) 2021 M5Stack), which includes LovyanGFX (FreeBSD
  license) and other parts listed in its README; of its fonts the firmware uses the default one (Adafruit GFX's,
  BSD) and Font2 and Font4 (Bodmer's TFT_eSPI, FreeBSD license);
- [LVGL](https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl) 9.6.0 (MIT, (c) 2025 LVGL Kft), with its built-in Montserrat fonts (SIL Open
  Font License 1.1), symbol font (from Font Awesome Free) and UNSCII 8 (by Viznut, public domain), from which
  `tools/fonts/px_fonts.py` makes the settings panel's pixel fonts (`src/px_fonts.c`).

## Downloaded at run time

**FreeDOS 1.4** (`FD14-LiteUSB.zip`, from download.freedos.org) is downloaded by the Tab5 or by
`tools/make_sdcard.py`. Neither this repository nor the firmware contains it. Its packages are under the GNU GPL and
other free licenses, each package's own. Disk images made from it are a separate deliverable (see
`docs/DISTRIBUTION.md`).
