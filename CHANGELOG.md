# Changelog

## Unreleased

- The settings panel on an empty card: no FreeDOS frame in place of the sliders any more; the Machine frame's
  **Install DOS** and **Install Linux** set up the first machine, as any other (its list reads "(none yet)"). The
  offer to start the PC from an installer CD's `.iso` at the card's root went with the frame (the README says how to
  set that up by hand); a machine set up that way by 1.2.0 still finishes its install as before.
- README: a screenshot of Sprig Linux starting; the empty card's panel.

## 1.2.0 (2026-10-28)

Machines by name, with DOS and Linux installed from the settings panel; a faster fast interpreter; fixes. The firmware
image with its notices and corresponding source, as for 1.1.0.

- `LICENSE` holds the plain MIT text (the list of third-party material is in `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`).
- Machines: the settings panel's **Machine** frame lists `default` (`/tiny386.ini`) and the machines named N
  (`/tiny386-N.ini`, their files in `/N`), and restarts into the one chosen, which stays chosen through every restart.
- **Install DOS** and **Install Linux** make a named machine: FreeDOS 1.4 (its own installer), or the latest
  [Sprig Linux](https://github.com/yejun/sprig-linux) release, every file checked against its checksums (installing
  it again with the same name updates its kernel, keeping its files). The Tab5 restarts into an install mode for it,
  with no PC running (all the memory free), then into the new machine. The empty card's **Install FreeDOS 1.4** asks
  for a name too.
- The fast interpreter (used with the translator off, and by the translator for what it leaves) is about 1.5 times
  as fast: its handlers in 16-bit, 32-bit and generic copies, cheaper memory and window checks, and pre-decoded
  blocks (`t386_fast_pd.h`; serial `pd`, `pd 0|1`), kept in the translator's code cache while it is off. A game's
  built-in benchmark with the translator off takes about 35% less time.
- A program that goes wild no longer takes the Tab5 down: an interrupt or exception that can't be delivered becomes
  a double fault, and if that fails too, a PC reset (a triple fault, as a board does); tiny386 aborted there.
- AAM with an immediate of 0 raises a divide error (`vendor/patches/0016`); it divided by 0.
- Fast interpreter fixes: MOVS from video memory with a null ES raised no #GP; a real-mode INT whose stack overlapped
  the vector table read the vector after pushing; exceptions in its handlers left the instructions before them out of
  the instruction count; pre-decoded blocks at addresses 0-2 missed stores into them, and code going to another page
  at every block (a loop over a page boundary with paging) didn't return to service devices.

## 1.1.0 (2026-10-26)

The PC's network, a faster translator (Linux too), VBE graphics modes, a DOS-era settings panel and web page, and
fixes. Firmware images with their notices and corresponding source, as for 1.0.0.

- The PC's network card (NE2000, port 300h, IRQ 9) is connected while Wi-Fi is on: a network of its own inside the
  Tab5 (192.168.77.0/24, the Tab5 at .1 with a DHCP server), routed to the Wi-Fi network with address translation;
  ports 2222, 2323 and 8080 of the Tab5 lead to the PC's 22, 23 and 80. Serial `net` shows the card's state.
- One lock for the SD card: the PC's disks (raw access) and FatFs (the web page, the settings panel) each had their
  own, and a command sent while the card was busy with the other's could time out, so a web download could end
  early. Downloads that fail now close the connection (the browser reports an error, not a shorter file).
- The translator: more instructions translated (SHLD/SHRD by CL and in memory, BSF/BSR, BT/BTS/BTR/BTC in memory
  with the bit number in a register, BSWAP, RDTSC, CMPXCHG, XADD, FWAIT); a bigger table of translated blocks; in
  protected mode with DS, ES and SS based at 0 (flat), their bases aren't added to every address. The fast
  interpreter computes the carry flag inline.
- tiny386 fixes (`vendor/patches`): CMPXCHG set the flags of destination - accumulator instead of accumulator -
  destination (0014); 64-bit integers and 80-bit values copied through the FPU (FILD/FISTP, FLD/FSTP) lost bits
  beyond a double's 53 (0015).
- The translator's description (README, `docs/NOTES.md`): it handles paged protected mode too.
- The PC's picture at 4:3, as a monitor showed every mode (the default): text, 320 x 200 and 640 x 350 graphics fill
  the panel's height like 640 x 480 (at most 960 x 720). A switch in the settings panel, or serial `aspect 43|square`,
  goes back to square pixels. Fixed with it: the last lines of a picture whose height isn't a multiple of 16
  (640 x 350) weren't redrawn, and the black around a picture was cleared on the wrong side upside down.
- tiny386 at upstream 1a8f1e0 (was d81e225), which has the task-switch and timer-mode fixes (patch 0011 and
  `t386_pit_fix.h` dropped) and VGA, PS/2, ATAPI and floppy fixes; patches 0002, 0004 and 0007 rebased onto it.
- Disk images that lie in pieces on the card (copied onto a card in use) are read and written as card sectors too,
  through a list of their pieces made at startup, instead of through FatFs, which walked the file's cluster chain on
  every backward seek. Reading a 3 MB file from an image in 590 pieces took 2.6 s instead of 85 s.
- Video memory in the VGA's other write modes is written without tiny386's callbacks: write mode 0 with rotation,
  set/reset, a logical operation or a bit mask, and write modes 2 and 3, by translated code itself, and read mode 1
  (colour compare) by the fast path. Twenty fills of the 640 x 480 x 16 screen with set/reset or write modes 2 and 3
  take about 6-7 BIOS ticks instead of 16-17. Writes go nowhere while the misc output register's RAM enable bit is
  clear, as in vga.c.
- VBE modes up to 1024 x 768 (were 720 x 480): 800 x 600 and 1024 x 768 with 256 colours, 32K and 64K, 800 x 600
  with 16M too (2 MB of video memory), drawn at their own size and scaled onto the panel by the PPA (1024 x 768 at
  960 x 720). tiny386's renderer cut off what lay beyond 720 x 480. The 1024 x 768 buffer (1.5 MB) is taken when
  there is the memory, else VBE modes stay at 720 x 480.
- What VBE modes' writes change (through the linear frame buffer or the 64 KB window) is marked in 2 KB pieces, and
  only those lines are read again: checking a still 1024 x 768 x 16 picture for changes takes 0.1 ms a frame instead
  of 15 ms.
- The copy of video memory each tiny386 refresh reads is 256 KB, not all of it: 1.3 MB more memory free.
- tiny386.ini [pc] ne2000_irq: the network card's interrupt (9 unless set; 3, 5, 7, 10, 11 or 15). Some NE2000 drivers
  don't work on 9, the second interrupt controller's line that stands in for 2.
- The linear frame buffer is mapped by the fast path's TLB straight to video memory, as RAM is: reads by translated
  code and the fast path at RAM speed, writes without a page walk and tiny386's callbacks (still marked for the
  screen). Its place comes from pc.c's BAR callback.
- The settings panel and the web page in a DOS-era look: the panel like a BIOS setup screen in a pixel font drawn
  at 2x3 and 3x4 (UNSCII), the web page like a DOS file manager.
- The settings panel's Wi-Fi switch moves as soon as it is tapped (it waited for Wi-Fi to start, a few seconds),
  with "Switching Wi-Fi on ..." meanwhile; its label toggles it too, and the switches take taps around them. After
  switching Wi-Fi on, the networks are scanned once it has connected (the list said to switch Wi-Fi on).
- A 2D engine for the linear frame buffer on port F1E0h (fill, copy, monochrome expansion, `src/t386_accel.h`), for
  a Linux guest whose vesafb uses it: its graphics console prints twice as fast.
- Linear frame buffer writes: a page is marked for the screen once per refresh, at its first write, then written at
  RAM speed until the next refresh (before, every write went through the TLB's slow path to mark its piece).
- The translator: jumps between blocks in different pages, and blocks whose last instruction runs into the next
  page, are linked (serial `jit xlink 0` turns that off). Translated code leaves for the dispatcher
  when tiny386 empties its TLB in place (INVLPG).
- tiny386 at upstream 003c266 (was 1a8f1e0): FXCH without losing precision, VGA line compare and pel panning,
  linuxstart's `vga=` option; patches 0002, 0013 and 0015 rebased (0015 now only the 80-bit moves).
- The translator's code sync writes back and drops cache lines twice, as ESP-IDF's own version of the write-back
  routine does (this build linked the ROM's). With one pass, new code occasionally ran as first emitted, before its
  jumps were patched: the rare stops in long runs of programs that redraw the whole screen. A 4-minute game demo 20
  times over and a DOS stress loop for 44 minutes ran without one (before, a stop within a few runs).
- FreeDOS's installer runs with the translator on again (it ran with it off after two of five installs had stopped
  partway, from the code sync above): copying took about 8 minutes.
- Restarts (the web page's, the installer's) no longer lose the SD card now and then: after a restart with the PC
  running from the card until just before, the card was sometimes missing (the PC started without disks) or the
  start hung, until the Tab5 was switched off; 3 in 30 restarts. The Tab5 now restarts through deep sleep, a fuller
  reset (30 of 30 found the card and Wi-Fi), and once more that way if the card is missing after a panic.
- Settings panel: the battery's state fits its title bar ("Charging 82% - ~0 h 37 min to full"); it took two lines,
  the second cut off. Volts and milliamps stay in the serial and web status.
- `tools/fetch_vendor.sh` applies ESP-Hosted's patch in a clone of this repository too: run inside another
  repository's work tree, `git apply` skipped the file and still reported success, so a build from a clone had the
  Wi-Fi link's driver unpatched (the 1.0.0 images were not affected).
- The PC's network is there from the start, Wi-Fi on or off (it started with Wi-Fi): with Wi-Fi off the PC still gets
  its address by DHCP, instead of its DHCP client waiting for a server that wasn't there (some systems stopped at a
  message about it). The DNS server handed out is now the Tab5 itself, relaying to the Wi-Fi network's DNS server of
  the moment, so names resolve on a lease taken before Wi-Fi was on or before it joined another network; with Wi-Fi
  off, lookups fail at once. Network setup failures leave the card unconnected instead of half set up.
- Serial `ptap x y` (a tap on the settings panel) and `mev dx dy buttons` (a PS/2 mouse event), for testing.

## 1.0.0 (2026-10-22)

The first public release: the source code, and firmware images with their notices and corresponding source (see
`docs/DISTRIBUTION.md`). No SD card images.

- A 386/486 PC on the M5Stack Tab5, built on tiny386 (pinned commit, with the patches in `vendor/patches`): VGA,
  PS/2 keyboard and mouse, Sound Blaster 16, AdLib, PC speaker, IDE hard disks, CD-ROM images, floppies, SeaBIOS.
- A fast interpreter and a translator to RISC-V code in front of tiny386's own CPU (see `docs/NOTES.md`).
- First start on an empty card: downloads FreeDOS 1.4 and runs its installer, or starts an installer CD image from
  the card; then sets the PC up to start from `C.IMG`. `tools/make_sdcard.py` prepares a card on a computer instead.
- The Tab5 Keyboard, USB keyboards and mice, and the touch screen as a touchpad.
- Copying files over Wi-Fi from a browser (the SD card and the PC's disks); `tools/upload.py` from a shell.
- The settings panel: Wi-Fi, brightness, volume, touchpad speed, pause and reset.
- The serial console: status, screenshots (`tools/shot.py`), commands.
