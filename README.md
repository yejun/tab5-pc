# Tab5 PC

A PC emulated on the M5Stack Tab5, built on [tiny386](https://github.com/hchunhui/tiny386): a 386/486 with VGA, a
PS/2 keyboard and mouse, a Sound Blaster 16, AdLib and PC speaker, IDE hard disks, CD-ROM images, floppies and
SeaBIOS. It runs DOS and Linux. On an empty SD card it downloads and installs FreeDOS or
[Sprig Linux](https://github.com/yejun/sprig-linux) by itself; files are copied to it over Wi-Fi from a browser.

This is an independent project, not affiliated with or endorsed by M5Stack. It is provided as is (see `LICENSE`).

## What you need

- An M5Stack Tab5 (ESP32-P4). The Tab5 Keyboard is recommended; a USB keyboard and mouse work too.
- A microSD card, FAT32 or exFAT, with at least 1 GB free.
- A Wi-Fi network with internet access for the FreeDOS download (or prepare the card on a computer, below).

To build the firmware:

- [Arduino CLI](https://arduino.github.io/arduino-cli/) with the M5Stack board package (`m5stack:esp32`, from
  `https://static-cdn.m5stack.com/resource/arduino/package_m5stack_index.json`) and the libraries M5Unified, M5GFX
  and lvgl. Built and tested with m5stack:esp32 3.3.10, M5Unified 0.2.29, M5GFX 0.3.0 and lvgl 9.6.0.
- git, curl, make, tar with xz, a C compiler, `xxd`, and the GitHub CLI (`gh`, logged in: `gh auth login`) for
  tiny386's BIOS images.
- Python 3: `python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt`. Run the tools with
  `.venv/bin/python` (`tools/make_sdcard.py` and `tools/dosdisk.py` also find `.venv` by themselves).
- Optional: dosfstools (`fsck.fat`; `brew install dosfstools` on macOS), with which `tools/make_sdcard.py` and
  `tools/dosdisk.py` check the disks they write.

## Ready-made firmware

Each [release](https://github.com/yejun/tab5-pc/releases) has the firmware as one image to write at address 0
(`tab5-pc-<version>-prev3.bin`, for the Tab5's ESP32-P4, revision v1.x), with its licenses and notices and the
corresponding source. Releases have no image for ESP32-P4 v3.x while no Tab5 with that chip is out (see below to build
one). It is also in M5Burner. To write it yourself:
`esptool --chip esp32p4 write-flash 0x0 tab5-pc-1.6.0-prev3.bin`.

## Build and flash

```
tools/fetch_vendor.sh            # tiny386 at the pinned commit (with the patches in vendor/patches),
                                 # its SeaBIOS images (the BIOS built here), and ESP-Hosted's SDIO driver
tools/build.sh upload            # build and flash (port /dev/ttyACM0; or: tools/build.sh upload /dev/ttyACM1)
```

The BIOS (SeaBIOS) is built from the pinned source with tiny386's patch, as `vendor/patches/0027` changes it (it
reports the math coprocessor), and the VGA BIOS comes from tiny386's release; both are checked against the tested
images pinned in `vendor/bios.lock`. Building the BIOS needs a gcc that can build 32-bit x86 code (on Debian or
Ubuntu, `gcc-multilib`). `BIOS_FROM_SOURCE=1 tools/fetch_vendor.sh` builds the VGA BIOS from source too.

ESP32-P4 chips come in two families: `esptool` reports "revision v1.x" for earlier ones (the default build) and
v3.x for later ones: `CHIP=postv3 tools/build.sh upload`. A build for the wrong family does not start.

## First start: FreeDOS on an empty card

1. Put an empty card in the Tab5 and switch it on. With nothing on the card, the settings panel opens with Wi-Fi
   on: choose your network on the right, then tap **DOS** in the Machine frame and give the machine a name (for
   example `dos`; tap again to confirm). The Tab5 restarts into its install mode, with no PC running, and shows how
   it goes. (**Linux** sets up Sprig Linux instead, and **ISO** a PC that starts from an installer CD on the card:
   see [More machines](#more-machines-dos-and-linux-side-by-side).)

   ![The settings panel on an empty card](docs/images/panel-install.png)

2. The Tab5 downloads FreeDOS 1.4's LiteUSB disk (18 MB, from freedos.org), makes the PC's hard disk
   (`/dos/C.IMG`, 512 MB, partitioned and formatted) and the machine's settings (`/tiny386-dos.ini`), and restarts
   into FreeDOS's own installer. Answer its questions: your
   language, **Yes** to proceed, **Yes** to format the drive (the installer calls it D:, as it started from its own
   disk), your keyboard, **Plain DOS system**, and **Yes** to install. (The questions that default to No need Up,
   then Enter.)

3. Copying the packages takes about 20 minutes. When the installer asks to reboot, say yes: the Tab5 sets the
   machine up to start from its `C.IMG` alone, removes the installer's files from the card, and adjusts `C:\FDAUTO.BAT` for this
   PC (its CD-ROM driver; the Sound Blaster's `BLASTER` setting). FreeDOS then starts at the `C:\>` prompt.

   ![FreeDOS installing, between the side panels](docs/images/fd-progress.png)

**Other ways to start:**

- **An installer CD**: the Machine frame's **ISO** (below), or by hand: put the `.iso` of a bootable installer CD
  (for example FreeDOS's LiveCD) on the card, make an empty hard disk (`.venv/bin/python tools/dosdisk.py new
  sdcard/C.IMG --mb 500`, copied to the card) and write a `tiny386.ini` with `hda = /sdcard/C.IMG` and
  `cdc = /sdcard/<name>.iso` (see [Settings](#settings)). The BIOS tries the hard disk first, so the PC starts from
  the CD while C: is empty, and from C: once a system is installed on it.
- **Prepare the card on a computer**: `.venv/bin/python tools/make_sdcard.py` makes `sdcard/C.IMG` (FreeDOS 1.4
  with all its packages, 32 MB), `sdcard/D.IMG` (504 MB, empty) and a matching `sdcard/tiny386.ini`. Copy the three
  files to the root of the card. It starts straight at the `C:\>` prompt.

## More machines: DOS and Linux side by side

The settings panel's **Machine** frame lists the machines on the card: `default` (`/tiny386.ini`) and every one
named N (`/tiny386-N.ini`, its files in the folder `/N`). Choose one and tap **Start** twice: the Tab5 restarts into
it, and keeps starting it, through every restart, until you choose another.

**DOS**, **Linux** and **ISO** install a new machine (DOS and Linux are downloaded: a saved Wi-Fi network is
needed): give it a name, tap again to confirm that the PC stops, and the Tab5 restarts into its install mode, with no
PC running, then into the new machine.

- **DOS**: FreeDOS 1.4, as above: its installer starts in the new machine.
- **Linux**: the latest release of [Sprig Linux](https://github.com/yejun/sprig-linux), a small Linux made for this
  PC (about 10 MB downloaded, 140 MB on the card), every file checked against the release's checksums. It starts
  with a graphics console (800 x 600); the machine's settings file says how to use the text console instead.
  Installing Linux again with the same name updates it: its kernel and loader are replaced, its disk (`root.img`,
  your files) is kept. (Its start is the picture at the top of this page.)

- **ISO**: a PC that starts from an installer CD. Copy the CD's `.iso` to the root of the card first (the web page's
  SD card tab), then choose it in the dialog (the machine's name is suggested from it). The new machine gets an empty
  hard disk (`C.IMG`, 512 MB, partitioned and formatted) and the CD in its drive; it starts from the CD while C: has
  no system, and from C: once the installer has put one there. The CD stays in the drive until the CD-ROM tray (see
  [Using it](#using-it)) takes it out.

A name already on the card (its settings file or its folder) can't be used again, except to update Sprig Linux. If an
install fails, the screen says why, and a tap goes back to the machine there was. Serial: `machines`,
`machine <file>`, `install dos <name>`, `install linux <name>`, `install iso <name> [<file>.iso]`.

## Using it

**The Tab5 Keyboard.** Aa, Ctrl and Alt are the PC's Shift, Ctrl and Alt. Sym is a layer (never sent to the PC):

| Sym + | gives | | Sym + | gives |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 ... 0 | F1 ... F10 | | ← → ↑ ↓ | Home, End, Page Up, Page Down |
| - and + | F11, F12 | | Backspace | Delete |
| Del | Insert | | Aa | Caps Lock |
| the symbol keys | their second symbol | | Esc | the settings panel |

Ctrl + Alt + Delete is Ctrl + Alt + Sym + Backspace. Sym + Alt + Up/Down sets the speaker volume. The left light
shows Sym or Aa held, the right one is green while the PC runs. Docked in the keyboard, the picture is turned to
match.

**USB.** A keyboard and mouse in the Tab5's USB-A port (also through a hub, or a wireless receiver) work alongside.
Scroll Lock opens the settings panel.

**The touch screen** is a touchpad for the PC's mouse: slide to move, tap to click, tap with two fingers for the
right button, tap and touch again to drag. DOS programs need a mouse driver (CTMOUSE, which FreeDOS loads).

**The side panels** beside the PC's picture, as on a PC's case: on the left **POWER** (hold it a second: the PC is
off; tap it: on again, starting afresh; the PC also goes off when its system powers it off, e.g. FreeDOS's
`FDAPM POWEROFF`), **RESET** (hold it a second), **PAUSE** (the PC's picture dims and stays still, the sound
stops) and **SETUP** (the settings panel); on the right the power light (green on, amber paused), the disk light (amber; both dim when off, as a real LED's
lens), the **CD-ROM** tray, a **camera** (screenshots) and the battery (red when low). A ring
fills around POWER's or RESET's icon while you hold it; a short tap on either does nothing while the PC runs.
From November 15 to January 6 the side panels are dressed for the holidays (snow, a garland, presents and a
snowman, a Santa hat on the camera), once the Tab5's clock has been set (opening its web page sets it; see
**Screenshots**).

**Screenshots**: tap the **camera** and the PC's picture is saved on the card in `screenshots/`, as a PNG named by the
day and that day's count (`2026-11-05_001.png`), at the picture's own size (640 x 400 for 80-column text, 320 x 200
for a 256-colour game, 800 x 600 for Sprig Linux's console ...). The camera's flash lights up, then its light shows
green for a moment (red: not saved, the card full or missing). The day comes from the Tab5's clock (it keeps UTC),
in your time zone: opening the Tab5's web page sets both from your browser, and while you have Wi-Fi on, the Tab5 also
checks the time with an internet time server (pool.ntp.org) every 3 hours. Over the serial console, `clock` shows
the time, `clock 2026-11-05 18:30:00` sets it (UTC) and `clock tz PST8PDT,M3.2.0,M11.1.0` the time zone, as a POSIX
TZ string. Serial `shot` takes a screenshot too.

**The CD-ROM drive**: every machine has one, empty unless its settings file names a disc. The tray shows the disc's
name; tap it for a dialog listing the `.iso` files at the root of the card (1 MB or more) and **No disc**: **Insert**
or **Eject** changes the disc while the PC runs, as with a real drive (FreeDOS notices within a few seconds; `dir` on
an empty drive says it is not ready). The disc is saved in the machine's settings file, so it is still in the drive
at the next start. Serial: `cd` shows the disc, `cd <file>.iso` inserts one, `cd -` ejects it.

**Sound**: the PC speaker, the Sound Blaster 16 (`BLASTER=A220 I5 D1 H5 T6`) and AdLib play through the Tab5's
speaker.

## Copying files over Wi-Fi

Wi-Fi is off until you switch it on. Open the settings panel (swipe down from the top edge, Sym + Esc, or Scroll Lock)
and switch on **Copy files over Wi-Fi**. The Tab5 joins your network and shows its address, e.g. `http://192.168.1.50/`.
Open it in a browser:

![The web page](docs/images/web.png)

- **The SD card tab** lists the card: disk images, CD images (`.iso`), `tiny386.ini`. Drop files or whole folders
  anywhere on the page to copy them. **Edit** opens text files (`tiny386.ini`, `.BAT`, `CONFIG.SYS`, ...); after
  saving `tiny386.ini` the page offers to restart the Tab5 with it.
- **The C: and D: tabs** open the PC's disks. This pauses the PC (DOS keeps parts of its disks in memory). When you
  press Done, or 30 s after the last change, the PC continues, restarted if anything changed. Do this at the DOS
  prompt, not while a program is saving.
- The images the PC has open can't be changed while it runs: **Delete** on one offers to stop the PC first (like
  switching it off). It stays stopped until **Start PC** restarts the Tab5.
- Long file names are stored with DOS short names (`LONGNA~1.TXT`).
- From a shell: `.venv/bin/python tools/upload.py <address> hdb /APPS ~/dos/myprog`, then
  `.venv/bin/python tools/upload.py <address> --done`.

Switch Wi-Fi off again when you are done. The Tab5 keeps the choice: after a restart or a power-off, Wi-Fi comes
back on or stays off as you last left it.

> **The file manager has no password.** Anyone who can reach the Tab5 on the network can read, change and delete
> everything on the card and the PC's disks while it is on. Switch it on only on a network you trust, and never make
> it reachable from the internet (no port forwarding, no exposed host).

### The PC's network

The PC's network card (NE2000, port 300h, IRQ 9) is connected to a small network inside the Tab5 (192.168.77.0/24; the
Tab5 at .1 hands out addresses by DHCP and answers DNS queries by passing them on to your Wi-Fi network's DNS server).
While Wi-Fi is on, it is routed to your Wi-Fi network with address translation, as a home router does; with Wi-Fi off,
the PC still gets its address, and its lookups fail at once. The PC reaches your network and the internet; from your
network, ports 2222, 2323 and 8080 of the Tab5 lead to the PC's 22, 23 and 80 (an SSH, Telnet or web server running in
it). DOS needs a packet driver for the NE2000 and a TCP/IP program; serial `net` shows the card's state. The same
warning applies: anything the PC serves on those ports is open to your network.

For example with FreeDOS's NE2000 packet driver (Crynwr's `NE2000.COM`) and [mTCP](https://www.brutman.com/mTCP/)
(DHCP, ping, FTP, Telnet, HTTP client and server, IRC, time), both free software, in `C:\NET` with an `MTCP.CFG`
that says `PACKETINT 0x60`:

```
C:\NET\NE2000 0x60 9 0x300
set MTCPCFG=C:\NET\MTCP.CFG
C:\NET\DHCP
C:\NET\HTGET -o PAGE.HTM http://example.com/
```

The graphical browser MicroWeb (built for mTCP, run from its own directory) shows plain-HTTP pages; most of
today's web needs HTTPS, which these programs don't do.

## Settings

**The settings panel** (swipe down from the top edge, Sym + Esc, or Scroll Lock; Done or Esc closes it): pause or
reset the PC (reset asks for a second tap), Wi-Fi for copying files and the network list, brightness, volume, the
touchpad's speed, the side panels on or off (off: the margins are black and part of the touchpad; the picture is
always 4:3, as on a monitor, text and 320 x 200 graphics stretched to the full height), and the machine to start or install
([More machines](#more-machines-dos-and-linux-side-by-side)). The top right shows the battery. While the panel is open the PC keeps running.

![The settings panel](docs/images/panel.png)

**`tiny386.ini`** at the root of the card describes the machine (or `tiny386-N.ini`, the machine named N, if it is
the one chosen in the panel); the Tab5 reads it when it starts:

| key | meaning |
|---|---|
| `[pc]` `hda` ... `hdd` | hard disk images, e.g. `hda = /sdcard/C.IMG` |
| `cda` ... `cdd` | CD-ROM images (`.iso`) |
| `fda`, `fdb` | floppy images (1.44 MB etc.) |
| `mem_size`, `vga_mem_size` | memory, e.g. `16M`, `2M` |
| `fill_cmos` | 1: the hard disks' geometry in the CMOS |
| `bios`, `vga_bios` | other BIOS images on the card (the built-in SeaBIOS otherwise) |
| `vga_force_8dm` | 0: text in the VGA's 9-dot cells (720 x 400); 8 dots wide otherwise (640 x 400, no stripes in shaded backgrounds) |
| `[cpu]` `gen` | 3, 4, 5, 6 = 386, 486, 586, 686 |
| `fpu` | 1: an x87 maths coprocessor |

Without a `cda`-`cdd` line a machine still has a CD-ROM drive, empty, as `cdc` (`cdd` if `hdc` is taken); the
CD-ROM tray writes the disc it inserts into this file. FreeDOS installed with Tab5 PC 1.3.0 or earlier has a `rem`
before the `CDROM.BAT` call in `C:\FDAUTO.BAT` (its CD-ROM driver): delete it to use the drive.

More disks: `.venv/bin/python tools/dosdisk.py new sdcard/E.IMG --mb 1000` makes an empty one (`hdc = /sdcard/E.IMG`);
`dosdisk.py put` and `ls` copy files in and list them on the computer.

**The serial console** (USB): `.venv/bin/python tools/console.py "S"` prints the status; `tools/shot.py out.png`
saves the PC's screen (`--panel`: the Tab5's). Commands are listed at the top of `firmware/tab5_386/tab5_386.ino`
(e.g. `wifi on`, `vol <0-255>`, `reset`, `type <text>`).

## Performance

The PC is roughly as fast as a 486 of the early 1990s for typical DOS programs: simple integer instructions run at
about 20-30 million a second. A fast interpreter in front of tiny386's own handles the common instructions, and a
translator turns frequently run code into RISC-V code (real, virtual-8086 and protected mode, paged or not). The x87 runs in
software, with single precision on the ESP32-P4's FPU where that gives the same result. Text and EGA/VGA programs
draw at up to ~30 frames a second; only what changed on the screen is redrawn.

Notes from the development are in [`docs/NOTES.md`](docs/NOTES.md).

  as a whole, MIT for the parts that come from QEMU/TinyEMU, BSD-3-Clause for inih, and **LGPL-2.1-or-later for the
  FMOPL AdLib synthesiser**, which this firmware compiles in.
- SeaBIOS and its VGA BIOS (LGPL-3.0), pinned in `vendor/bios.lock` and built into the firmware.
